# MyCourse app

This project was created under the request of interview team of Cal Poly IT team

## If this is your first Angular 5 project, please do following to set up it locally 

1. Install node (recommend version 8+)
   `https://nodejs.org/en/download/`
   
2. Update npm
   `sudo npm update`
   
   install typescript
   `npm install -g typescript`

3. Check out (clone) this project to a local directory 

   `git clone https://github.com/xujiyuan/calpoly.git myCourse `
    
    Npm install to pull all the dependencies 
    `npm install`

   You do not need IDE to run or review angular app, if you want, I recommend the most recent version of
   webstorm, atom and sublime 3

4. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via Karma. Please open your local browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9876/`.
